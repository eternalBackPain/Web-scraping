# Web scraping

My First Web Scraper - Scraping NSW Case Law - Court of Appeal

Test the output of the scrape by viewing the terminal. The issue i run into now is how to bring this server side result into the client side to show on the browser
write "npm run start" into the terminal

Learning web scraping with the goal of scraping -> natural language processing (see for eg RiTa) -> data visualisation
